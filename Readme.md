# Header Bidding System Using Prebid.js

This project implements a header bidding system with Prebid.js to optimize ad revenue on a publisher's website. It integrates multiple Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs) and ensures that ad units are responsive across various devices.

## Project Overview

The header bidding setup uses Prebid.js in conjunction with Google Publisher Tags (GPT) to manage and auction ad slots in real time. This approach increases revenue potential by allowing multiple advertisers to bid on ad space simultaneously.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.
- Access to a web server or a local development setup capable of serving HTML.

### Files in the Project

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing markup for ad slots.
- **js/main.js**: This file contains all configurations for Prebid.js, including ad unit definitions, bidder setups, and event handlers.
- **.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml**: Defines the GitHub Actions pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

### How to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/header-bidding-setup.git
   cd header-bidding-setup
### Open `index.html` in a Web Browser

- **Local or Server Hosting**: This file can be served locally or from a web server.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Ensure you have internet connectivity to load Prebid.js and fetch SSP bids correctly.

### Configure Ad Units and SSPs in `js/main.js`

- **Configuration**: Modify the placeholder SSP account details and ad unit configurations with actual data from your ad partners.

## Tools Used

- **Prebid.js**: A robust header bidding platform for web publishers.
- **Google Publisher Tags (GPT)**: Allows dynamic ad slot definition and management.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository and manages version control.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, facilitating automatic builds and deployments upon code commits.

## Analytics and Monitoring

- **Google Analytics**: Integrated to monitor bid performance, win rates, and latency metrics. Update the `js/main.js` file to configure tracking IDs.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Comprehensive Error Management**: The system features comprehensive error handling to log and address issues during the bidding process, such as bid timeouts or invalid responses. These events are captured in the JavaScript console and can be further integrated with server-side logging tools if required.

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions for CI/CD

- **Automated Deployment**: The CI/CD pipeline is configured to automatically deploy the project to the specified server when changes are pushed to the main branch.
- **Server Details and Secrets**: Be sure to set up your server details and secrets (`HOST`, `USERNAME`, `SSH_KEY`) in the GitHub repository settings under Secrets.
